In hexadecimal notation, A is typically written in uppercase.
  However, it's also common to see hexadecimal values written in lowercase, 
  as in 0xa. Both 0xA and 0xa represent the same value, which is 10 in decimal.

In programming languages such as C, C++, Java, and many others, 
you can use either uppercase or lowercase letters when writing hexadecimal numbers. 
  The language will interpret them as the same value.

So, in summary:

0xA = 0xa = 10 (in decimal) = 1010 (in binary)
