I apologize for any confusion. If adding a newline character (\n) to the printf statement makes it work, that means the output was buffered, and the newline character helped flush the buffer, making the output appear.

In C, the standard output (stdout), which is where printf writes by default, is line-buffered when writing to a terminal. This means that the output is stored in a buffer until a newline character is encountered or the buffer is full, at which point it is flushed and the content is displayed on the terminal.

So, when you add a newline character to the printf statement like this:

c
Copy code
printf("%s\n", game->map[1]);
Save to grepper
It forces the buffer to be flushed immediately, and you see the output on the terminal.

Without the newline character, you might still see the output, but it could appear delayed or mixed with other outputs, depending on the behavior of the underlying buffer.

Again, I apologize for any confusion caused. Adding a newline character to the printf statement is a common technique to ensure immediate output when using line-buffered streams.
