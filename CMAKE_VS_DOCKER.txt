If your goal is to develop cross-platform software (e.g., a library or application meant to run natively on Windows, Linux, and macOS), 
CMake might be your primary tool. It will help you manage builds across these platforms.

If you're looking to ensure consistent behavior, deployment, or isolate your development environment, 
then Docker will be more relevant.

Combining Both: Many projects use both. For example, you might use CMake to handle cross-platform builds 
and then package the built software in a Docker container for deployment or distribution.
