The first line defines a macro named ADMIN. The second line uses the #ifndef directive to check if the ADMIN macro has been defined. If it has not been defined, then the code between the #ifndef and #endif directives will be included in the compiled code. In this case, the code that will be included is the loguser() function.

The loguser() function is a function that logs the user who is currently logged into the system. This function is only necessary if the user is an administrator. By using the #ifndef directive, we can ensure that the loguser() function is only included in the compiled code if the user is an administrator.

Here is an explanation of the code line by line:

C
#define ADMIN

This line defines a macro named ADMIN. The macro does not expand to any value, it is simply a placeholder.

C
#ifndef ADMIN
loguser();
#endif
