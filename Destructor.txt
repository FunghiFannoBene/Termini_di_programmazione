This is the destructor of the Zombie class. Destructors are special member functions that are called automatically 
when an object of the class is destroyed or goes out of scope. The destructor is responsible for cleaning up resources 
allocated to the object. The ~ symbol is used to define a destructor.
In this case, the destructor doesn't take any parameters, and void is written in parentheses to indicate that it 
doesn't take any arguments.
