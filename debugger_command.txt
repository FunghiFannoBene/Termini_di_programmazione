Set next statement

There’s one more debugging command that’s used fairly uncommonly, but is still at least worth knowing about, 
even if you won’t use it very often. The set next statement command allows us to change the point of execution 
to some other statement (sometimes informally called jumping). This can be used to jump the point of execution
forwards and skip some code that would otherwise execute, or backwards and have something that already executed run again.


  run to cursor(right click) while debugger is running.
